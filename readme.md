# Limine bootloader API bindings for Odin

This repository contains limine bootloader API bindings that I use for personal
projects that I thought might be useful for other people attempting to do OSdev
in Odin.

For an example of usage see [my kernel](https://github.com/flysand7/odin-os/tree/main/boot/limine).
